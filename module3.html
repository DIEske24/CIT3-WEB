        <h1><i class="fas fa-handshake"></i> Consent & Boundaries</h1>
        <p>Consent is a fundamental aspect of any healthy relationship, ensuring that all parties involved willingly agree to any interaction. Understanding boundaries and respecting personal limits helps create a culture of mutual respect and safety.</p>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-comment-dots"></i> What is Consent?</h2>
        <p>Consent means giving voluntary, enthusiastic, and informed permission for something to happen. It must be ongoing and can be withdrawn at any time. There are different types of consent, including verbal, non-verbal, and digital consent.</p>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-expand"></i> Recognizing Healthy and Unhealthy Boundaries</h2>
        <p>Boundaries define what a person is comfortable with in relationships, whether emotional, physical, or social. Healthy boundaries involve clear communication and mutual respect, while unhealthy boundaries can include pressure, manipulation, or coercion.</p>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Understanding Coercion and Power Dynamics</h2>
        <p>Coercion is when someone is pressured into giving consent through threats, guilt, or manipulation. Power imbalances—such as between employers and employees, teachers and students, or older and younger individuals—can also impact a person's ability to give true consent.</p>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> How to Communicate Boundaries</h2>
        <p>Effective communication helps establish and maintain boundaries. This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Clearly expressing your limits</li>
                <li>Respecting when others say "no"</li>
                <li>Checking in regularly to ensure comfort levels are maintained</li>
                <li>Understanding that boundaries can change over time</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i> Consent in Digital Spaces</h2>
        <p>With technology playing a major role in relationships, digital consent has become crucial. Sharing intimate photos or conversations without permission is a violation of privacy and trust. Always ask before sharing personal information and respect others' digital boundaries.</p>
