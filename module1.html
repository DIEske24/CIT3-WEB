        <h1><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Introduction to Sex Education</h1>
        <p>Sex education is an essential part of human development, providing individuals with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to make informed decisions about their health and relationships. This module explores the following key areas:</p>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-star"></i> The Importance of Sex Education</h2>
        <p>Sex education helps individuals understand their bodies, develop healthy relationships, and make informed choices regarding their sexual and reproductive health. A well-rounded sex education program covers physical, emotional, and social aspects of human sexuality, empowering individuals to practice safe behaviors and reduce risks associated with misinformation.</p>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> Common Myths and Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>Many myths surround sex education, leading to confusion and misinformation. Some believe that sex education encourages early sexual activity, but research has shown that comprehensive sex education actually delays sexual initiation and promotes responsible behavior. Another common misconception is that discussing contraception encourages promiscuity, but in reality, it helps individuals understand the importance of protection and responsibility.</p>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-users"></i> The Role of Parents, Schools, and Communities</h2>
        <p>Providing accurate and inclusive sex education is a shared responsibility. Schools offer structured programs, while parents provide moral guidance and values. Communities, including healthcare professionals and advocacy groups, play a crucial role in ensuring that young people have access to factual, stigma-free information. Open communication between these stakeholders helps create a supportive environment for learning.</p>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-child"></i> Understanding Puberty and Bodily Changes</h2>
        <p>Puberty is a critical phase of human development, marked by physical, emotional, and hormonal changes. For males, puberty includes voice deepening, facial hair growth, and increased testosterone production. For females, it involves breast development, menstruation, and hormonal shifts. Understanding these changes helps individuals navigate this stage with confidence and reduces anxiety associated with bodily transitions.</p>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Preventing Abuse and Promoting Safe Practices</h2>
        <p>Sex education teaches individuals about consent, personal boundaries, and recognizing abusive behaviors. It helps young people identify unsafe situations, develop refusal skills, and seek support when needed. Learning about healthy relationships, respect, and mutual consent empowers individuals to make safe choices and establish positive connections.</p>
