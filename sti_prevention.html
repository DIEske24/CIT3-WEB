            <h2>STI Prevention</h2>
            <p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are spread through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Some STIs can cause serious health problems if left untreated. Prevention is key to maintaining sexual health and well-being.</p>

            <h3>Common Types of STIs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bacterial STIs:</strong> Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis (can be treated with antibiotics).</li>
                <li><strong>Viral STIs:</strong> HIV, herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), and hepatitis B (some are manageable but not curable).</li>
                <li><strong>Parasitic STIs:</strong> Trichomoniasis and pubic lice (can be treated with medication).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ways to Prevent STIs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Condoms and Barriers:</strong> Male and female condoms reduce the risk of STIs. Dental dams can be used for oral sex.</li>
                <li><strong>Get Vaccinated:</strong> The HPV vaccine protects against strains that cause cervical cancer and genital warts. The hepatitis B vaccine prevents liver infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Get Tested Regularly:</strong> Routine STI testing ensures early detection and treatment. Even if no symptoms are present, some infections can be asymptomatic.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit Sexual Partners:</strong> Reducing the number of partners decreases the risk of exposure to STIs.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutual Monogamy:</strong> Being in a mutually monogamous relationship where both partners are tested can reduce STI risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Safe Sex:</strong> Avoid high-risk behaviors, such as unprotected sex, multiple partners, or sharing needles.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):</strong> A daily pill that significantly reduces the risk of contracting HIV.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):</strong> Emergency medication taken within 72 hours after potential HIV exposure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to Do If You Test Positive for an STI</h3>
            <p>If you test positive for an STI, do not panic. Many STIs are treatable and manageable. Follow these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consult a healthcare provider immediately.</li>
                <li>Inform sexual partners so they can get tested and treated.</li>
                <li>Follow the prescribed treatment plan completely.</li>
                <li>Avoid sexual contact until treatment is completed.</li>
                <li>Continue practicing safe sex to prevent reinfection.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Myths & Facts About STIs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> You can tell if someone has an STI by looking at them.<br>
                    <strong>Fact:</strong> Many STIs have no visible symptoms and can only be detected through testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Only promiscuous people get STIs.<br>
                    <strong>Fact:</strong> Anyone who is sexually active can contract an STI, regardless of the number of partners.</li>

                    <strong>Fact:</strong> Some STIs can remain asymptomatic for years, making regular testing essential.</li>
