            <h2>What is Consent?</h2>
            <p>Consent is a clear and voluntary agreement between individuals before engaging in any form of sexual activity. It is based on mutual respect and understanding, ensuring that all parties involved are comfortable and willing participants.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Principles of Consent</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Freely Given:</strong> Consent must be given without pressure, manipulation, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</li>
                <li><strong>Reversible:</strong> A person can change their mind and withdraw consent at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Informed:</strong> Everyone involved should fully understand what they are consenting to.</li>
                <li><strong>Enthusiastic:</strong> A clear and excited “yes” means consent, whereas silence or uncertainty does not.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Agreeing to one activity does not mean agreeing to others.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why Consent is Important</h3>
            <p>Consent is fundamental to healthy relationships and personal autonomy. It helps build trust, promotes respect, and prevents harm. Without proper consent, an action can become coercive, abusive, or even illegal.</p>
            
            <h3>Understanding Non-Verbal Cues</h3>
            <p>While verbal consent is the clearest way to communicate agreement, non-verbal cues also play a role. Signs that someone may not be giving full consent include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hesitation or avoidance</li>
                <li>Lack of enthusiasm or passive behavior</li>
                <li>Silence or uncertainty</li>
                <li>Attempts to move away or disengage</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Consent in Different Situations</h3>
            <p>Consent is not just about sexual activity; it applies to many aspects of life, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Asking before hugging or touching someone.</li>
                <li><strong>Medical Procedures:</strong> Doctors must obtain consent before treatment.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Interactions:</strong> Respecting personal boundaries in conversations and physical space.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Dispelling Myths About Consent</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> If someone doesn’t say no, it means yes.<br>
                    <strong>Fact:</strong> Consent must be an active, enthusiastic yes, not just the absence of no.</li>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> Consent once given is permanent.<br>
                    <strong>Fact:</strong> Consent can be withdrawn at any time, regardless of prior agreement.</li>
                <li><strong>Myth:</strong> If someone is intoxicated, they can still give consent.<br>
                    <strong>Fact:</strong> A person under the influence of drugs or alcohol cannot give proper consent.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Understanding consent helps create a society where respect, safety, and equality are valued.</p>
