        <h1>Reproductive Health</h1>
        <p>Reproductive health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system. This module explores key aspects of reproductive health, including anatomy, fertility, contraception, and reproductive rights.</p>
        
        <h2>Understanding the Reproductive System</h2>
        <p>The human reproductive system is responsible for producing, storing, and delivering reproductive cells. In males, it includes the testes, sperm ducts, and prostate gland, while in females, it consists of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. Hormones such as estrogen and testosterone play crucial roles in regulating reproductive functions.</p>
        
        <h2>Menstrual Health and Fertility</h2>
        <p>Menstruation is a natural process that occurs in females, signaling reproductive maturity. The menstrual cycle typically lasts 28 days and consists of four phases: menstruation, follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase. Understanding this cycle is important for tracking fertility and managing reproductive health issues like PCOS and endometriosis.</p>
        
        <h2>Contraception and Family Planning</h2>
        <p>Contraception allows individuals to plan and space pregnancies effectively. Methods include barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms), hormonal methods (birth control pills, patches, implants), intrauterine devices (IUDs), and permanent solutions like vasectomy and tubal ligation. Emergency contraception is also available for preventing unintended pregnancies after unprotected intercourse.</p>
        
        <h2>Common Reproductive Health Issues</h2>
        <p>Some reproductive health concerns include sexually transmitted infections (STIs), infertility, and reproductive cancers. Regular screenings, such as Pap smears and prostate exams, help detect conditions early, ensuring better treatment outcomes. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, practicing safe sex, and getting vaccinated for HPV and hepatitis B contribute to reproductive well-being.</p>
        
        <h2>Reproductive Rights and Access to Healthcare</h2>
        <p>Reproductive rights encompass the ability to make informed choices about reproduction, including access to contraception, prenatal care, and safe childbirth. Globally, access to reproductive healthcare varies, with many advocating for improved education and healthcare services to support reproductive autonomy.</p>
        
        <p>By completing this module, you will develop a deeper understanding of reproductive health and learn how to make informed decisions regarding your well-being.</p>
