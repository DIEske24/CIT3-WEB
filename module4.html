        <h1>Safe Sex Practices</h1>
        <p>Practicing safe sex is essential for preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancies. Understanding different protection methods and their effectiveness helps individuals make informed decisions about their sexual health. This module covers:</p>
        
        <h2>Barrier Methods</h2>
        <p>Barrier methods prevent the exchange of bodily fluids and reduce the risk of infections and pregnancy. Examples include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Male and female condoms:</strong> Provide protection against STIs and pregnancy.</li>
                <li><strong>Dental dams:</strong> Used for oral sex to reduce STI transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Diaphragms:</strong> A barrier inserted into the vagina before intercourse.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Hormonal and Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC)</h2>
        <p>Hormonal contraceptives prevent pregnancy by altering the menstrual cycle. These include:
            <ul>
                <li>Birth control pills, patches, and injections.</li>
                <li>Implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs).</li>
                <li>Emergency contraception (Plan B or the morning-after pill).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Preventing and Managing STIs</h2>
        <p>STIs can have long-term health effects if left untreated. Prevention strategies include:
            <ul>
                <li>Getting vaccinated against HPV and Hepatitis B.</li>
                <li>Regular STI testing, especially when changing partners.</li>
                <li>Using protection consistently and correctly.</li>
                <li>Communicating with partners about sexual history and STI status.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Abstinence and Mutual Monogamy</h2>
        <p>Abstinence (not engaging in sexual activity) is the most effective way to prevent STIs and pregnancy. Mutual monogamy, where both partners commit to a long-term relationship with regular STI testing, also reduces risk.</p>
        
        <p>By completing this module, you will understand the importance of safe sex practices and how to take responsibility for your sexual health.</p>
