        <h1>Sexual Orientation & Identity</h1>
        <p>Sexual orientation and gender identity are fundamental aspects of who we are. Understanding these concepts fosters inclusivity, self-awareness, and respect for diverse identities. This module covers the following:</p>
        
        <h2>Understanding Sexual Orientation</h2>
        <p>Sexual orientation refers to whom an individual is romantically or sexually attracted to. It is a spectrum that includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Heterosexuality – Attraction to the opposite gender.</li>
                <li>Homosexuality – Attraction to the same gender (gay, lesbian).</li>
                <li>Bisexuality – Attraction to both men and women.</li>
                <li>Pansexuality – Attraction to people regardless of gender.</li>
                <li>Asexuality – Little to no sexual attraction to others.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Gender Identity vs. Gender Expression</h2>
        <p>Gender identity is an individual's internal understanding of their gender, which may or may not align with their sex assigned at birth. Gender expression, on the other hand, is how a person presents themselves through clothing, behavior, and mannerisms. Key identities include:
            <ul>
                <li>Cisgender – Gender identity matches assigned sex.</li>
                <li>Transgender – Gender identity differs from assigned sex.</li>
                <li>Non-binary – A gender identity outside the male-female binary.</li>
                <li>Genderfluid – A gender identity that shifts over time.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Challenges Faced by LGBTQ+ Individuals</h2>
        <p>LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination, lack of acceptance, and mental health challenges due to societal stigma. Common issues include:
            <ul>
                <li>Bullying and social exclusion.</li>
                <li>Workplace and healthcare discrimination.</li>
                <li>Limited legal rights and protections in some areas.</li>
                <li>Mental health struggles due to lack of acceptance.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>How to Be an Ally</h2>
        <p>Supporting the LGBTQ+ community involves:
            <ul>
                <li>Using inclusive language and respecting pronouns.</li>
                <li>Standing against discrimination and prejudice.</li>
                <li>Educating yourself on LGBTQ+ history and rights.</li>
                <li>Creating safe spaces for open conversations.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>By completing this module, you will gain a deeper understanding of sexual orientation, gender identity, and ways to promote inclusivity in society.</p>
